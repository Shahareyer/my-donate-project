                    have devasted
                    north-eastern Bangladesh this year. His entire village was hit with severe flooding following the
                    rainfall, leaving his home underwater. His family is sheltering in a school building, without enough
                    food. “I’ve only eaten dried rice with milk today because there are six of us and not enough rations
                    for all of us,” Sihab says.</p>
